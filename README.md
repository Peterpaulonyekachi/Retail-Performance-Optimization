# Project Overview
## Sales, Orders & Profitability Analysis â€“ Retail Company
In this project, I led the development of a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for a retail company facing declining profit margins despite growing sales. The goal was to uncover key business insights and support data-driven decision-making by analyzing historical performance across orders, products, customer segments, and regions.

## Key Focus Areas:
- Sales & Profit Trends: Monthly analysis of over $1.58M in total sales, $173K in total profit, and 8,399 customer orders, helping identify peak and low-performing months.

- Customer Segmentation: Evaluated profitability across segments (e.g., Corporate, Consumer, Small Business), revealing Corporate as the most profitable.

- Product Performance: Highlighted top-performing products and identified loss-generating sub-categories like Tables and Storage & Organization for strategic review.

- Geographic Performance: Pinpointed states with the highest revenue (e.g., New York, Texas) and profit margins, aiding regional marketing strategy.

- Discount & Shipping Impact: Assessed correlation between high discounting and low profit, and reviewed shipping costs by mode and region, identifying cost inefficiencies with Delivery  Truck mode.

- Case Metrics: Included key KPIs such as Average Order Value ($189), Average Discount (5%), and Average Shipping Cost ($13).

## Impact & Outcome:
- Enabled the business to identify low-margin high-volume products, optimize discounts, and streamline shipping.

- Provided granular visibility into performance drivers, supporting targeted marketing, pricing, and inventory decisions.

- Served as a central tool for C-suite reporting and operational planning.
